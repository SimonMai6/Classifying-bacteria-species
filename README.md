Kaggle Competition

Project description:  Our task is to classify 10 different bacteria species using data from a genomic analysis technique that has some data compression and data loss.

Project details: The dataset in the project has 288 columns and 200000 rows. It has a column called “target,” which is the  y (label), and a column called “row_id,” with the rest of the 286 columns being the X (tags). The tags are the ten different kinds of bacteria species.

Goal: Create a predictive model to predict the bacteria species based on 10-mer snippets of DNA.
